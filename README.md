## 🎯 Company Overview

**Obligate Solutions** operates as a technology services and execution brand under **ThoughtNut Innovation Labs LLP**, serving clients and partners across the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and other global markets.

### Our Core Problem Statement

> Lack of ownership in execution.

At Obligate Solutions, delivery is not optional — it is **obligated**.

### What "Obligate" Means

**Obligate** stands for responsibility, duty, and ownership.

For us, it means:
- ✅ Owning outcomes, not just tasks
- ✅ Accountability over excuses
- ✅ Execution over promises

When we commit to a project, **delivery becomes non-negotiable**.
